But soldiers��� concerts out here are different indeed from those at home. At home there are civilians and lots of smiling people in a well-lit hall. Here in Flanders it���s a whitewashed schoolhouse with a stone floor, and the light is penny dips and the audience is only the khaki coated Tommy with his pipe in his mouth. Often they sing with no accompaniment and the predominant note is a dull low dreary melancholy about ���Dead for bread��� or something of that sort. Be the song dismal, be the singer a bass and be there no accompaniment and roll the song on without rhythm thro��� interminable stories of the woes of existence, the clamour and applause is great. Not that Tommy is downhearted or dull, on the contrary, but he is a bit of a sentimentalist as one understands as he joins with right good will in ���Dear Homeland - goodbye��� or ���When Irish Eyes are Smiling��� or other suchlike sentimental ditties.\r\n\r\nBut the pipes out here sound grand. It���s a great thing to be a Scotsman and it���s tremendous to be in a Scottish regiment with its pipes in this land of France. When the pipes play and we go swinging along we feel so much better than the poor, blue-coated Frenchy and we strut mightily proud thro��� the streets of France. And at concerts with the tobacco smoke and the songs and the atmosphere it awakens memories of the great broad moorlands and the swirl of the wind and the clean sky and how we hate the Sassenach intruder. It must be the remains of that primitive instinct that made the Highland raiders come from their mists and their hilltops with their plaids wound tightly round them, and holding a good claymore come down into the lowlands to garner what they could by force and steel.\r\n\r\n\",'love',15,1915,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Popular_music,15,Popular_music,1915\r\n60,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1434718246310,\"I knew the owner of the Dreamland and was allowed to sit in a dark corner of the balcony to listen to the music.

(���) When we met in New York he was very nervous about the approaching performance. Granados was like a child about his music. He really attached no importance to it- it was just something that poured out of him- and he always questioned its value. As with his first opera twenty years before when we were both youths in Barcelona, he asked me if I would assist him with the rehearsals. He was so tense during the rehearsals at the Metropolitan Opera House that he never said a word except when someone addressed a question to him. He didn���t speak English, and so when one of the musicians would ask him what interpretation he would prefer in some portion of the work, I would translate the question. Granados would answer, ���Just tell them to play whatever way they think best.��� It was typical of him. He felt that musicians playing his works should decide for themselves what would be the best rendition. The music was of course marvellous, and I tried to relive my friend���s anxiety by telling him what an important success the opera would be. On the opening night he saw for himself! The opera received a tumultuous ovation, one of the most amazing I have ever witnessed. People in the audience stood and shouted and wept.  \r\n\",'fear',16,1916,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera,16,Opera,1916\r\n92,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1401870300064,\"I���ve just come across a bundle of old newspapers giving accounts of the film of the Somme battle now being shown at the Scala in London.

I am quite certain that each one of them imagined me to be somebody different, whom he knew at home. We began. Now I am small, and they were all rather large. Furthermore, the Lancers as the British Army - Other Ranks - dance it, is a highly rollicking affair. In this famous first set, I was the only woman on the floor and we soon were the only set.
